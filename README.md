Circuit Analysis Package (WIP)

Part of the algorithm used to develop this software is based on following document: https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/mna/MNA2.html.

The data input is similar to `spice` family simulators. I'm using ngspice manual: (http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf) as reference, but for now, I don't have intention of full compatibility. This project started as a motivation to learn better how a simulator works under the hood.
